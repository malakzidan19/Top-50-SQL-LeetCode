## question-->
A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.
Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

## notes-->
1)In the subquery, MAX() works on the filtered unique values (those appearing once),
but in the main query with GROUP BY, MAX() applies to each group separately, not the whole result.
2)"An alias is required so that SQL can treat the temporary result of the subquery as a named table."
3)The MAX() function returns NULL when there are no values to evaluate.

## code-->
select max(num) as num
from (select num 
from MyNumbers
group by num 
having count(*)=1) as unique_numbers
