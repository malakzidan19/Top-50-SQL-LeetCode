## question-->
We define query quality as:The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.We also define poor query percentage as:The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.
Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places

## notes -->
We calculate the percentage of poor queries based on their rating.
1--  Syntax of CASE:
CASE
  WHEN condition THEN value_if_true
  ELSE value_if_false
END
2-- CASE is applied to each row ,Then SUM adds them up based on the query_name.
3-- Multiplying by 100.0 (not 100) forces floating-point division, which avoids integer rounding.

## code-->
select q.query_name , round(avg(q.rating *1.0/ q.position ),2) as  quality ,
round(sum(case when q.rating<3 then 1 else 0 end )*100.0/count(*),2)
as poor_query_percentage
from Queries q
group by query_name
