## question-->
Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.

## notes-->
We calculate the average experience of employees working on each project.
- By default, `AVG()` may return an **integer** if all input values are integers.
- To avoid losing decimal precision, we **multiply the values by `1.0`** inside the `AVG()` function.
- This forces floating-point division and ensures the result is returned as a **float**.
- We then use `ROUND(..., 2)` to limit the result to **2 decimal places** for clean and readable output.
- ROUND(numeric_expression, decimal_places)

## code-->
select p.project_id  , round(avg(1.0 *e.experience_years) , 2) as  average_years
from Project p join Employee e
on p.employee_id = e.employee_id 
group by p.project_id
