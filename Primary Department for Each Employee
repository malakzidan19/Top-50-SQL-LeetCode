## question-->
Write a solution to report all the employees with their primary department.
For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.
Return the result table in any order.

## notes-->
1)Select employees with only one department:
Use GROUP BY and HAVING COUNT(*) = 1 to get employee IDs that appear only once 
(i.e., assigned to one department only).
2)Combine them with employees whose primary_flag = 'Y':
Use UNION to merge both results: those with only one department and those marked as primary ('Y').

## code-->
select employee_id, department_id
from Employee
where primary_flag = 'Y'
union
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
where employee_id in 
(
    select  employee_id 
    from Employee
    group by employee_id 
    having count(*)=1
)
