## question-->
Write a solution to find the monthly transactions report which includes for each month and country:
The number of transactions (trans_count)
The number of approved transactions (approved_count)
The total transaction amount (trans_total_amount)
The total approved transaction amount (approved_total_amount)

## notes-->
1-- FORMAT(date_column, 'yyyy-MM')
-yyyy (all lowercase) -> year
-MM (both capital)  ->number of month
-mm (lowercase)  -> minutes, not months
2-- case syntax:
CASE
  WHEN condition THEN value_if_true
  ELSE value_if_false
END
3--'approved'  ✅ , "approved"	❌  
"double quotes" are only used when enclosing column or table names.for string values, always use single quotes ' '.

## code-->
select FORMAT(trans_date,'yyyy-MM') as  month ,country ,
count(*) as  trans_count,
sum(case when t.state='approved' then 1 else 0 end) as approved_count,
sum(t.amount) as trans_total_amount,
sum(case when t.state='approved' then amount else 0 end) as approved_total_amount
from Transactions t
group by FORMAT(trans_date,'yyyy-MM'), country
