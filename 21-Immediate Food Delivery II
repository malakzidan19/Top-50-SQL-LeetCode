## question-->
If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.
Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

## notes-->
the WHERE clause filters only the first order for each customer using MIN(order_date) grouped by customer_id.
Then, we count how many of those first orders are immediate (when order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date).
We divide the number of immediate first orders by the total number of first orders.
Finally, we round the result to 2 decimal places

## code -->
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select round(sum(case when order_date=customer_pref_delivery_date then 1 else 0 end)*100.0/count(*),2) as  immediate_percentage
from Delivery d
where (customer_id , order_date )in
(select customer_id ,min(order_date)
from Delivery d
group by customer_id )
